# Conflict with Teammate
(Redis加不加Kafka)
* **Situation**: During my previous role as a Full-stack developer, I was part of a team working on a new feature for our company's main product, which is using cache stragetry to improve the query performance for estimated delivery time. A conflict arose with a teammate, let's call him Jack, who disagreed with my proposed implementation approach, preferring a different and more complex metod.
* **Task**: My task was to resolve this conflict in a way that would not only maintain team harmony but also ensure the best technical approach was chosen for our project.
* **Action**: 
  * Firstly, I initiated a meeting with Jack to understand his perspective and concerns. I listened attentively to his reasoning and explained my viewpoints and the benefits of my approach, including better maintainability and faster implementation time.
  * Realizing that we were both not fully aligned, I suggested that we can present both approaches to the team and gather input. During the team meeting, we discussed the pros and cons of each method in detail. I made sure to keep the discussion focused on the technical metrits of each approach rather than personal preferences.
* **Result**: The team utimately decided that a combination of both our approaches was the best way forward. This hybrid solution combined the robustness of Jack's method with the simplicity of mine. This resolution not only led to the successful completion of the feature but also improved my professional relationship with Jack. We both appreciated each othet's expertise and commitment to the project. This experience taught me the value of collaboration, open communication, and the importance of considering different perspectives in problem-solving. 

# What's a significant achievement in your work?
* **Situation**: In my previous job as a software developer intern, I was assgined to work on the project focusing on building an e-commerce platform for hardware sales. The stakes were high: due to the pandemic, the company faced significant challenges with offline shopping and needed to transition its platform online rapidly while maintaining customer satisfaction, 
* **Task**: My task was to develop the feature for automatically sending a survey email after an enterprise placed an order. This was an area where we struggled to get timely feedback, leading to missed opportunities for improvement and a low repurchase rate, so it was crucial to execute this feature effectively.
* **Actions**
  * **Deep Research:** I first did a deep dive into the technical documents and explored how Kafka and thrid party API could be leveraged to implement asynchronous email sending.
  * **Template Design:** Next, I met with the UX Team to discuss Dynamic Content Population in emails and met with the Manager to discuss the retry mechanism in order to reduce the risk of lost or unprocessed emails. After several iterations, we finalized the best approach.
* **Results**： When we went live, the survey feature received positive feedback from major clients. Their suggestions on product quality and delivery times boosted repurchase rates and built customer trust. In the first quarter after we launched the feature, the sales jump by 30%, which gave a huge boost to company profits. It was exciting to see the direct impact my work had on the business.
* **Reflection**: Through this achievement, I learned that even small changes, when made with the user’s perspective in mind, can have a huge positive impact. The success of the project itself was hugely satisfying, but more importantly, I knew that I earned the trust of the client and my teammates. I became more confident in leading and collaborating on complex projects.
