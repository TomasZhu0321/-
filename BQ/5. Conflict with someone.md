# 1.1 Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult team member or stakeholder. How did you handle the situation, and what was the outcome?

**Situation (S):**  
During a school project, I was the leader of a team tasked with designing and deploying a microservices system within one semester. However, there was one team member consistently missed deadlines and produced low-quality code, which significantly affected our progress.

**Task (T):**  
As the team leader, I felt responsible to address this issue to ensure the project stayed on track and to support my teammate in improving his performance.

**Action (A):**  
To tackle this, I first reviewed the code for the module he was responsible for, so I could provide specific feedback. Then, I scheduled a private meeting with him to discuss the issues. During our discussion, I adopted a supportive and empathetic approach. I started by acknowledging his efforts and contributions to the team. Then, I clearly pointed out the areas that needed improvement and emphasized the seriousness of the professor's repeated reminders about our lagging progress. I asked for his perspective on the issues and listened to his concerns.

Together, we identified the root causes of his difficulties, which included a lack of understanding of certain technical aspects and his struggle to adapt to the fast-paced group development mode due to language and environmental adjustments after recently moving to Canada. I offered to help him understand the course material by meeting at the library to code and discuss together, shared relevant learning resources, and reduced his workload by taking on some of his tasks myself.

**Result (R):**  
After receiving the feedback, my teammate's performance improved significantly. Our project progress got back on track, and he expressed gratitude for the constructive feedback and support, which also strengthened our team's cohesion.

This experience taught me the importance of giving timely and constructive feedback, and how providing support and understanding can lead to significant improvements and a more cohesive team.

# 1.2 Conflict with teammates
## Situation (S):
* During a school project, I was the leader of a team tasked with designing and deploying a microservices system within one semester. However, one of my teammates consistently missed deadlines and produced low-quality code, which significantly affected our progress. This created tension within the team, as the rest of us were concerned about meeting deadlines and maintaining quality standards, while my teammate seemed unaware of the impact of his work.

## Task (T):
* As the team leader, it was my responsibility to address this issue and **resolve the conflict**. I needed to ensure that the project **stayed on track** while helping my teammate improve his performance without demotivating him or **causing further friction** within the team.

## Action (A):
* So, I arranged a private meeting with him to discuss the situation. I approached the conversation with empathy, acknowledging his efforts but also explaining how his missed deadlines and coding issues were affecting the team’s progress and our ability to meet the professor’s expectations.

* During the conversation, I learned that he was struggling with some technical aspects of the project and adapting to the fast pace of group development, especially after recently moving to Canada. To resolve the conflict, we agreed on a plan: I would provide extra help with the technical challenges by meeting him outside of class, sharing resources, and taking on some of his workload to ease the pressure on him. In exchange, he committed to improving his coding and communication with the team.

## Result (R):
* The conflict was resolved positively, and after receiving feedback and support, my teammate's performance improved. We were able to get the project back on track and successfully complete it by the deadline. Additionally, our team cohesion strengthened as we worked more collaboratively, and my teammate expressed gratitude for the support.

# 1.3 Disagreement 
## Situation (S):
During a school project, I was the leader of a team tasked with designing and deploying a microservices system within one semester. Early in the project, I had a disagreement with one of my teammates about how to **approach** the system development. My teammate believed we should immediately start dividing tasks and working on individual components. However, I strongly felt that we needed to **spend time upfront** doing a **thorough system-wide brainstorming** and **service mapping** to ensure the independence of each service and the overall system's functionality once integrated.

## Task (T):
As the team leader, it was my responsibility to resolve this disagreement in a way that kept the project on track and ensured the quality of our distributed system. I needed to convince my teammate of the long-term benefits of initial system design without demotivating him or slowing down the project’s momentum.

## Action (A):
I scheduled a meeting with my teammate to discuss our differing opinions. During the meeting, I presented the benefits of dedicating time at the beginning for a thorough system architecture design. I explained how planning out the distribution of services and their dependencies could prevent significant issues later on, such as integration challenges and overlapping responsibilities between services. I emphasized that a well-structured design would save us time and rework in the long run. Though my teammate was initially skeptical, he allowed me to present my case fully. After further discussion, he understood my perspective and agreed to collaborate on the initial design.

## Result (R):
By aligning on the importance of early system design, we avoided potential problems down the road and were able to efficiently build our distributed system. As a result, we successfully delivered the project by the end of the semester. The collaborative effort on the system’s architecture not only improved our project’s quality but also fostered better teamwork throughout the process.

## Reflection:
Looking back, I’m happy I handled the disagreement proactively and thoughtfully. This experience reinforced the importance of addressing differing opinions early, using clear communication and evidence to support my point. It also showed me the value of being open to others’ viewpoints and working toward a shared understanding to ensure project success.

## Situation (S):
During a school project to design a distributed system, I was the leader of the team. Early on, I disagreed with a teammate who wanted to divide tasks and start working right away, while I believed we needed to first **map out the system architecture** to ensure each service's independence and the system’s overall functionality.
## Task (T):
As the leader, it was my responsibility to resolve this disagreement while keeping the project on track. I needed to convince my teammate of the **long-term benefits** of initial system design without delaying the project’s progress.
