# Why you are interested in Affirm?
作为一个千禧一代，我深知Buy now Pay Later行业的快速发展及其对我们这一代人的吸引力。Actually, 我第一次了解到Affirm是我的一个美国朋友使用Affirm购买iPhone 15 Pro, 选择的24 months的贷款，每个月只用还很少的金额的经历，让我亲身体会到这种服务的便利性和灵活性。这也让我对Affirm致力于提供负担得起的金融服务的使命产生了强烈的认同感。
作为一名软件工程师，我被Affirm在金融科技领域的创新所吸引。我有两年的后端开发实习经验，主要使用Java和Kotlin，这与Affirm的技术栈非常匹配。并且我十分擅长将开发中遇到的问题进行归纳，并开发组件进行解决。比如，为解决公司**多线程处理不及时**的问题,我开发了一个动态线程池组件。该组件能监控并动态调整线程数量,解决了项目上线后无法及时根据需求调整的痛点。组件在多个团队间实现了复用,提高了60%的开发效率。我相信这种性能优化能力对Affirm这样需处理大量并发交易的平台至关重要。
Besides, 我在保险和电商行业的实习经历让我积累了开发和发布可扩展后端系统的丰富经验。例如，我运用Strategy Design Pattern重构了支付功能，显著提高了跨省份价格计算的灵活性和可扩展性。这不仅将新省份的payment模块实现时间缩短了50%，还大大提升了代码的可维护性和可测试性。
我相信我将大型代码库和复杂问题进行拆分并高效解决的能力，以及我对可扩展、清晰和优雅的软件架构的追求，与Affirm对软件工程师的高标准要求高度吻合.并且我期待能够为开发直接影响人们生活的产品做出贡献。

Actually, I first learned about Affirm through a friend in the US who used it to pay for his iPhone 14 Pro with a 24-month plan. He told me that he only needed to pay a small amount each month, and showed me the convenience and flexibility of this service. It sparked my strong interest in Affirm's mission of providing affordable financial services and I began to learn about the Buy Now Pay Later industry and its rapid growth, especially among our generation.

As a software engineer, I'm drawn to Affirm's innovations in the fintech space. Besides, My background of two year back-end developemnt in insurance and e-commerce has provided me with **valuable knowledge** and **technical insights** applicable to fintech. For example, one of the common technical challenges among fintech industries is handling the **high-volume concurrent transactions.**

During my previous internship, our company's system also faced a similar problem that cannot adjusts the number of threads when platform went live, leading to **inefficiencies of handling multi-tasks**. I took the initiative to propose completing this task and successfully developed a dynamic thread pool component. This solution effectively processes **large numbers of transaction requests** and quickly **scales processing capacity during traffic surges**. I'm also proud that this component has been adopted across multiple teams, improving development efficiency by 60%.

I believe my capability of **identifying development challenges**, breaking them down to small pieces and **creating component-based solutions** can make great contribution to Affrim's team. And I'm excited to join Affirm's open, inclusive environment and apply my problem-solving approach to financial services.

With two years of backend development experience in insurance and e-commerce, I've gained valuable knowledge and technical insights applicable to fintech. I mean One of the common development challenges these industries face is handling a large volume of concurrent transactions and tasks. During my previous internship, I developed a dynamic thread pool component that can monitor and dynamically adjust the number of threads after deployment. This component effectively processes a large number of transaction requests, improving the system's ability to quickly scale up processing capacity during traffic surges. Also, I'm proud to say that this component I developed has been adopted across multiple teams, improving development efficiency by 60%. I believe my capability of **identifying development challenges**, breaking them down to small pieces and  **creating component-based solutions** can also make contribution to Affrim's team.

primarily using Java and Kotlin, which aligns well with Affirm's tech stack. I excel at **identifying development challenges** and **creating component-based solutions**. For example, in my last internship, to address the company's issue with **untimely multi-thread processing**, I developed a dynamic thread pool component. This component can monitor and dynamically adjust the number of threads, solving the pain point of being unable to promptly adjust thread counts based on demand after project deployment. And I am proud to say that the component has been reused across multiple teams, improving development efficiency by 60%. I believe this kind of **performance optimization capability** is crucial for platforms like Affirm that need to handle a **large volume of concurrent transactions**.

<!-- Furthermore, my internships in the insurance and e-commerce sectors have given me **valuable experience** in developing and deploying scalable backend systems. For example, I refactored a payment function using the Strategy Design Pattern, significantly enhancing the flexibility and scalability of **different provinces tax calculations**. This not only reduced the implementation time for new provincial payment modules by 50% but also greatly improved the code's maintainability and testability. -->

I believe my ability to **efficiently break down and solve complex problems**, coupled with my commitment to **scalable, clean, and elegant software architecture**, aligns closely with Affirm's high standards for software engineers. I'm eager to contribute to developing products that have a direct, positive impact on people's lives.
