# What Specifically drew you to our graduate program, and why should we chose you for the role for the program?

I’m excited to join Bell’s Graduate Program because of its structured training and development system, which I believe will provide a strong foundation for my first full-time role after graduation. With access to mentorship, cutting-edge technology, and real-world projects, I’m confident this program will equip me with the skills to make meaningful contributions both now and in the future.

I graduated from McMaster University with a degree in Computer Engineering and have nearly two years of internship experience in full-stack and back-end development. My experience spans Java, JavaScript, React, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I’ve also contributed to B2B solutions during my internships, which aligns well with Bell’s focus on developing business opportunities and product roadmaps.

My passion for continuous learning led me to recently earn AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certified Developer certifications, further enhancing my ability to quickly adapt and apply new technologies. I’m confident that my technical skills, along with fresh perspectives, will enable me to bring innovative ideas to Bell's collaborative environment.

The Bell Graduate Program offers the ideal platform for me to grow while contributing to impactful projects, and I’m eager to leverage my skills and B2B experience to help Bell achieve its goals.
