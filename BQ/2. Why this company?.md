# What Specifically drew you to our graduate program, and why should we chose you for the role for the program?

I’m excited to join Bell’s Graduate Program because of its structured training and development system. With access to mentorship, cutting-edge technology, and real-world projects, I strongly believe this program will equip me with the skills to make meaningful contributions both now and in the future.

I graduated from McMaster University with a master degree in Computer Engineering this year and have nearly two years of internship experience in full-stack and back-end development. I have worked with programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. Additionally, I have experience with databases and caching tools, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Moreover, my passion for continuous learning recently drove me to earn both the AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certified Developer certifications

During my previous internships, I contributed to B2B solutions in industries like insurance, e-commerce, and the public sector, which aligns well with Bell’s focus on driving business growth. These experiences also provided me with valuable opportunities to address diverse business challenges and hone my problem-solving skills.

<!-- In addition, my passion for continuous learning recently drove me to earn both the AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certified Developer certifications, which have further strengthened my ability to quickly adapt to and apply new technologies. -->

I’m confident that my technical skills, along with fresh perspectives, will enable me to bring innovative ideas to Bell's collaborative environment and I’m eager to leverage my skills and B2B experience in past to help Bell achieve its goals.
