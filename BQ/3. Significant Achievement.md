# 1.1 What's a significant achievement in your work?

# 完整版
## Situation
* In my previous job as a back-end developer intern, I was assigned to work on a critical project aimed at helping my company recover from a downturn in performance due to the pandemic. The project focused on building a B2B e-commerce platform for hardware sales, with high stakes as the company needed to rapidly shift to online sales to recover lost revenue. We faced immense pressure to deliver within a tight deadline to ensure the company’s recovery and growth.

## Task
* My task was to develop the feature for automatically sending a survey email after an enterprise placed an order. This was an area where we struggled to get timely feedback, leading to missed opportunities for improvement and a low repurchase rate, so it was crucial to execute this feature effectively.

## Actions
* **Deep Research:** I first did a deep dive into the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and explored how Kafka could be leveraged to implement asynchronous email sending.
* **Template Design:** Next, after conducting extensive online research, I wrote 5 email templates. I collaborated with my manager and colleagues, and after several iterations, we finalized the best version.
* **Integration and Testing:** Finally, I added this feature to the project and communicated regularly with the rest of my team to ensure smooth integration with the platform. 
## Results
* When we went live, the survey feature received positive feedback from major clients. Their suggestions on product quality and delivery times boosted repurchase rates and built customer trust. In the first quarter after we launched the feature, the sales jump by 30%, which gave a huge boost to company profits. It was exciting to see the direct impact my work had on the business.

## Reflection
* Through this achievement, I learned that even small changes, when made with the user’s perspective in mind, can have a huge positive impact. The success of the project was hugely satisfying, but more importantly, I knew that I earned the trust of the client and my teammates. I became more confident in leading and collaborating on complex projects.
