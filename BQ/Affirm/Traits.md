# Weakness
* What is it: My weakness was that I used to underestimate the importance of documentation in software development. Initially, I focused solely on writing code that worked, without properly documenting it.
* 问题：
    * My weakness was that I used to underestimate the importance of documentation in software development. Initially, I focused solely on writing code that worked, without properly documenting it.
    * Reduced code reusability
* 措施
    * Started using standardized documentation templates
    * Wrote API documentation with clear examples
    * Set aside specific time for documentation during development
    * Put in Confluence 
* 结果
    * Better code maintainability
    * Reduced time spent explaining code to others
    * Improved team collaboration
* Learning
    * Through this experience, I learned that good documentation is as important as the code itself. Now it's an integral part of my development process, and I continue to improve my documentation practices.
