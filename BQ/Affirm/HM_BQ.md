## About Affirm

- **Company history** You should have a general understanding of the company, such as company size and age, locations, business model, and CEO.
- **Company values** Understand the core values and whether or not they align with yours. For example, [Diversity & Inclusion](https://www.affirm.com/downloads/2018_Affirm_Diversity_and_Inclusion_Report.pdf) is a central priority at Affirm. We have 13 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), all created and led by employees to bring together members and allies of underrepresented identities at the company. 
- **Job description** We're eager to meet people who believe in Affirm's mission and can contribute to our team in a variety of ways – not just candidates who check all the boxes. That being said, you should have a solid understanding of what the role entails and how your skills, attributes, and goals might align. 
- **The product or service** Make sure you know what the company is providing. Try using the product or service yourself, if possible. 
- **Your interviewers** Check out the website bios and/or Linkedin profiles of your interviewers so you can ask more informed questions.
- **Know what you want** What would you actually get out of this role? What does the role do for your professional goals? Prepare a list of your top 3-5 motivators and know how they align with the information you researched.
- **Review the STAR interview method** The [STAR method](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf), which stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result, is a structured way of responding to behavioral interview questions. Many companies utilize this format to evaluate candidate responses. There are plenty of articles available online which discuss the method in depth, so I won’t go into detail here. 
  - *Pro-tip*: don’t forget to get to the R (Result)! This is probably the most important component and unfortunately, many candidates forget to discuss it.
