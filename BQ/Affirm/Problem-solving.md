## 回答
### Situatin
*  Two critical deadlines collided
    * As a backend developer for the Children Insurance team, I was responsible for developing a school query REST API for our first sprint delivery
    * Simultaneously working on an independent Dynamic Thread Pool component. Both projects had upcoming deadlines around the same time.
### Task
* Make quick decisions about project prioritization
* Balance the development of both components
* Ensure quality delivery while meeting deadlines

### Action
I approached this challenge systematically:
#### Analysis & Decision Making
* Quickly evaluated both projects' status and impact:
    * School Query API (40% complete)
        * Critical for team's sprint delivery
        * Clear requirements and predictable timeline
        * Blocking other team members' progress
    * Dynamic Thread Pool (70% complete)
        * Independent optimization project
        * More complex architecture,uncertain timeline
        * Non-blocking for current sprint
#### Proactive Communication
* Aligned with team members on
    * Impact on dependent development tasks
    * Present my analysis and proposed prioritization
    * Agree on API-first approach with one week delay for Thread Pool
* Maintained daily updates on development progress
### Result 
* Successfully delivered the School Query API on time for sprint release
* Completed Dynamic Thread Pool component with 5 days ahead new deadline
* Maintained code quality for both deliverables

### Learn
The importance of proactive communication and transparent trade-off discussions with stakeholders was a valuable lesson for my career development.


# Innovative solution
## Situation
* Our company was expanding insurance services from Ontario and British Columbia to other Canadian provinces. The existing payment system had become a significant bottleneck due to its rigid architecture. The core problem was that all provincial payment calculations were handled through complex if-else statements in the code. Every time we needed to add support for a new province, we had to modify the core logic, which was risky and time-consuming.
## Task
* As the lead developer on this project, I was responsible for redesigning the payment system to make it more flexible and maintainable. My goal was to create a solution that would allow us to easily add new provinces without touching existing code.
## Action:
* I proposed an innovative solution using the Strategy Pattern, which was quite different from our traditional approach. Here's how I implemented it:
1. First, I designed a clean strategy interface that standardized how provincial payment calculations would be handled.
2. Then, I created separate strategy classes for each province, encapsulating their specific calculation logic. This was innovative for our team because it completely changed how we handled provincial variations.
3. I implemented a strategy factory to manage these different provincial implementations, making it easy to add new provinces without modifying existing code.
4. To ensure a safe transition, I took an incremental approach:
* Started with comprehensive unit tests to establish a baseline
* Migrated one province at a time
* Validated each step before moving forward
## Result 
This innovative approach delivered significant improvements:
* We reduced the time needed to add a new province from one week to just 2-3 days - a 50% efficiency gain.
* Our code quality metrics improved dramatically, with unit test coverage reaching 95%.
* Most importantly, we could now add support for new provinces without touching the core payment logic, significantly reducing risk.

## 追问
### Why did you choose Strategy Pattern over other patterns?
* It provided true runtime flexibility to switch between different provincial calculations
* It achieved complete separation of concerns - each province's logic is isolated
* It made unit testing significantly easier as we could test each strategy independently

### How did you ensure the transition was safe
* **Incremental approach**
1. Started with Ontario as our pilot province:
```java
// First implemented the Ontario strategy
public class OntarioPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculate(Payment payment) {
        // Ontario-specific calculation logic
    }
}

// Wrote JUnit tests to verify the new implementation
@Test
public void testOntarioPaymentCalculation() {
    OntarioPaymentStrategy strategy = new OntarioPaymentStrategy();
    Payment payment = new Payment(1000, "Ontario");
    double result = strategy.calculate(payment);
    assertEquals(1130.0, result);
}
```
2. After validating Ontario's success, I repeated the same process for BC and Manitoba
