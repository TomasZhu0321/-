## 回答
### Situatin
*  Two critical deadlines collided
    * As a backend developer for the Children Insurance team, I was responsible for developing a school query REST API for our first sprint delivery
    * Simultaneously working on an independent Dynamic Thread Pool component. Both projects had upcoming deadlines around the same time.
### Task
* Make quick decisions about project prioritization
* Balance the development of both components
* Ensure quality delivery while meeting deadlines

### Action
I approached this challenge systematically:
#### Analysis & Decision Making

    * School Query API (40% complete)
        * Critical for team's sprint delivery
        * Clear requirements and predictable timeline
        * Blocking other team members' progress
    * Dynamic Thread Pool (70% complete)
        * Independent optimization project
        * More complex architecture,uncertain timeline
        * Non-blocking for current sprint
#### Proactive Communication
* Aligned with team members on
    * Impact on dependent development tasks
    * Present my analysis and proposed prioritization
    * Agree on API-first approach with one week delay for Thread Pool
* Maintained daily updates on development progress
### Result
