## 回答
### Situation
* **Challenge**: Our company faced significant challenges with **thread pool management** across different business teams
    * 进一步解释: 2点
        1. heavily rely on personal experience,required system redeployment ==> risky and time-consuming
        2. Different business scenarios: For I/O-intensive tasks like email services, we configured thread pools differently than CPU-intensive tasks like insurance calculations
### Task
* **Initiative** : I proposed a solution to reduce the operational cost of thread pool management by migrating thread pool parameters from hardcoded values to a distributed configuration center. 
* **Task**: My task was to implement this dynamic thread pool component that would enable real-time parameter adjustments without system redeployment while providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

### Action: 
Focusing on three key areas:
* Technical Implementation:
    * Created a thread pool starter component that business services could easily integrate, implementing dynamic adjustment logic for corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize, and workQueue parameters
    * Developed Redis integration for configuration storage and distribution using pub/sub channels
    * Built a standalone admin platform for centralized management with web interfaces for real-time adjustments
* Cross-functional Collaboration:
    * Worked with the Operations team to:
        * Integrate Prometheus monitoring
        * Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization
        * Configure alert rules
    * Collaborated with development teams to:
        * Define key metrics (active_count, maximumPoolSize, queue size, completed tasks)
        * Establish alert thresholds (e.g., active/poolSize > 0.8)
* Developed comprehensive technical documentation and user guides to help teams adopt the solution, and published them to Confluence.

### Result
* Received positive feedback from team members about the component's reliability and ease of use"
* Delivered a working component that was adopted by multiple insurance business lines (travel, truck, and children insurance)
* Learned a great deal about thread pool management, Redis, and monitoring systems

# How did you handle a project that was behind schedule?
## 回答侧重点
### Situation:
* Clearly identify why the project was behind schedule:
  * Unexpected technical challenges
  * Resource constraints

#### Tactical Adjustments:
* Broke down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
* Set interim milestones for better tracking
* Prioritized critical path items
* Made necessary scope adjustments
#### Communication & Collaboration:
* Kept stakeholders informed of status and plan
* Sought help when needed
* Regular progress updates
* Clear escalation when necessary
### Result:
* Quantifiable outcomes:
  * How much of the delay was recovered
  * Quality maintained despite pressure
