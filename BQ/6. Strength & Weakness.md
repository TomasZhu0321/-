# Greatest strength 
One of my biggest strengths is my curiosity and passion for new technologies, and I consider myself a fast learner. After studying cloud computing in school, I developed a strong interest in cloud technology and began learning independently during my free time. In just three months, I progressed from a beginner to a certified cloud developer by Amazon.

To learn this new technology, I started by exploring the AWS website, reading manuals, and watching videos to build a foundational understanding. I then applied my knowledge by working on small projects to gain hands-on experience. After a month of focused learning, I passed the Cloud Practitioner certification in March, which gave me a solid grasp of AWS services. However, I didn't stop there—two months later, I earned the AWS Developer Certification.

Throughout this journey, I faced several challenges, but I overcame them using Stack Overflow and other online resources. I also sought guidance from a professor with expertise in cloud technologies.

Once I was confident in my abilities, I successfully deployed a microservices project I had worked on in school to AWS. This project showcased my understanding of AWS in a real-world scenario.

# Weakness
I can sometimes be a people-pleaser, prioritizing others' needs and opinions over my own, which affects my ability to make objective decisions.

How did you improve:
I've recognized this as a weakness and have been actively working on it. I understand the importance of balancing empathy and assertiveness in my role. To improve, I’ve been focusing on setting clear boundaries and ensuring I voice my own opinions and concerns when needed.

Impact and Result:
Earlier in my career, I often agreed with team members' suggestions without sharing my perspective, which sometimes led to project delays. After recognizing this, I made a conscious effort to speak up during meetings and share my views. This has led to more thorough discussions and better-informed decisions. Since then, I've noticed improvements in my decision-making process and confidence in team interactions. Being more assertive has allowed me to contribute more effectively to team goals and maintain healthier professional relationships. My goal is to continue developing this balance, ensuring I remain both supportive and decisive.
