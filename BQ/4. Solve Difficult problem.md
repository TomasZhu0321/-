# 1.1 Tell us about a time when you solved a difficult problem using analytical skill and critical thinking?

## Situation (S):
During my first internship, I was assigned the task of optimizing MySQL performance for a government homepage. The site was experiencing **slow response times** due to **complex search queries**, which impacted the user experience.

## Task (T):
I was responsible for **analyzing the root cause of** the slow queries and implementing a solution to **reduce computational overhead**, speed up response times, and improve the user experience **without compromising accuracy**.

## Action (A):
To begin with, I analyzed the **performance logs** and **query execution times** to identify any immediate bottlenecks in the system. When no clear issues surfaced, I ran a series of tests using **query profiling tools** to gain more insights. After multiple rounds of testing, I discovered that the heavy use of join operations across several tables was significantly slowing down the system, especially under **higher loads**.

Next, I examined the query structure carefully and found that many joins were being processed unnecessarily, so I refactored the queries using deferred join strategies to ensure that joins were executed only when absolutely necessary.

## Result (R):
The optimizations led to a significant reduction in search query response times, and the system was able to handle higher traffic more efficiently. This experience taught me the importance of critical thinking and a systematic, analytical approach to problem-solving, especially when addressing complex performance issues.
