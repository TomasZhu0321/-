# Project you worked on where you didn't have all the skills you needed
## Situation (S):
During my internship, I was tasked with designing an automated testing application using Selenium for the QA team, despite having no prior experience with the tool.

## Task (T):
I needed to quickly learn Selenium, develop a fully functioning application, and present a demo within two weeks, with a company leader attending the presentation.

## Action (A):
To tackle this, I started by estimating the workload and creating a structured plan to manage my time effectively. I allocated the first two days to learning the basics of Selenium, focusing on tutorials, documentation, and sample projects to quickly gain a high level knowledge of the tool.

Once I felt comfortable with the fundamentals, I moved into practical application, spending the majority of my time building the project. I believe that hands-on practice, where I can address challenges as they arise, is the most effective way to learn new skills.

During the development process, I encountered a complex code logic issue. Recognizing that I needed additional help, I reached out to a colleague with experience in Selenium. After discussing the problem, I was able to implement the solution and continue building the application. 

## Result (R):
The demo was a success, and the application significantly reduced the QA teamâ€™s manual workload, greatly improving their efficiency. This experience reinforced my ability to quickly acquire new skills and deliver results under pressure.
